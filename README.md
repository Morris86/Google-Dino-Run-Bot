# Google-Dino-Run-Bot

This is a bot for Google-Dino-Run (https://www.trex-game.skipser.com/)

In order for this to run, it requires 1080p resolution cause the pixel coordinates wound be different if you use other resolutions.

To set it up, spit the screen in half, put it on the left and start the program.

Disclaimer: this might not work every time due to windows unable to split the screen evenly (even if it's just 1 pixel), so there are some obstacles that the bot won't be able to react in time.

The bot highest score is around 25000, it could be higher if the condition is perfect.
